# My-First-Microgame
I chose the FPS Microgame in Unity. I added some new weapons, modified them a little, and put enemies around them to make them harder to get. I added 2 new rooms, which hold the weapons and enemies.
I added a shotgun and a launcher. I changed the shotguns model by a bit and made it a little different, and gave it a aimpoint.
I added an altar room which contains the launcher but you need to first defeat 2 hoverbots
I added a room which has a turret in it and has the shotgun.

Reflection: I really didn't have a plan on what to do, but I just decided to try to add a new gun, which didn't work. I instead changed the shotguns model, and gave it an aimpoint. I added 2 rooms, which atleast did not have much problems, other than the fact that I had to close the doors. If I had a challenge it would be that how I couldn't really navigate Unity for awhile.
